## There are three sections to this repository:
* Initial Processing
  * This is the initial parsing of raw logs to form proper spreadsheets for later statistical processing
* Post Processing
  * This is the statistical processing, producing some numerical statistics as well as multiple graphs
* Passeuss
  * This is an implementation of the password scheme we devised (including a testing process for gathering data from users)
  * The password scheme essentially boils down to generating a 4-word password, with words taken from Dr. Seuss novels
    * This allows for 4228250625 combinations as we are using ~250 words
  * The password scheme requires [Processing](https://processing.org/)
